The SPICE Scarborough Pilot for Income from Carbon Ecosystems proposed a universal basic income for nature
SPICE is my City of Toronto Climate Action Project that formulates a basic income concept for the inclusive carbon economy by financially compensating the thousands of volunteer hours that go into protecting Scarborough's diverse ecosystem of more than 1100 plant species, and 200 bird species. 

Toronto has the highest youth unemployment in Canada, and more than a third of women aged 55 to 64 have no retirement savings at all (Grady, 2025).  We need to move beyond old volunteering into new compensated-roles with nature. Scarborough differs from the rest of the Toronto area in that Scarborough is home to a plethora of natural ecosystems, rivers, lakes and beaches. As an example of token holders, Mark McAllister reports that in 2016, volunteers for The Great Nurdle Hunt reported finding between 100 and 1,000 pellets with less than 10 minutes of searching the shores near Scarborough’s Guildwood Beach.

This model reimagines Universal Basic Income by tying it to environmental stewardship. Individuals will earn not only for hours volunteered but also for the carbon sinks they help sustain or grow. Over time, these contributions form a pooled carbon fund—similar to a pension system—where long-term ecological impact translates into financial security in a scenario where carbon stewardship becomes a long-term economic asset, almost like a green pension.

Scarborough deserves it.
